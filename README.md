## Project Overview
This project explores the comparative effectiveness of AI-driven trading strategies against traditional human-led technical analysis in portfolio management. The study was conducted as part of the FA-800 course, aiming to shed light on the evolving landscape of financial analytics and the potential synergies between human expertise and machine intelligence in navigating complex financial markets.

## Key Findings
- Technical analysis outperformed the AI trading bot approach across several key metrics.
- The human-led strategy demonstrated higher returns, lower volatility, stronger correlation with the market, better risk-adjusted returns, stronger recovery capability from drawdowns, and less severe drawdowns compared to the AI trading bot approach.
- While AI excels in processing vast amounts of data and executing trades swiftly, human traders bring invaluable qualities such as intuition, adaptability, judgment, and ethical consideration.

## Methodology
1. **Stock Selection and Portfolio Construction**: Utilized a systematic approach to select stocks from five key sectors: Healthcare, Energy, Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials.
2. **Portfolio Risk Analysis**: Conducted comprehensive risk analysis using various financial metrics and visualization techniques.
3. **Technical Analysis (Human Trading)**: Implemented a strategy based on Simple Moving Average (SMA) and various financial ratios.
4. **AI Trading Strategy**: Developed an AI-driven approach using sentiment analysis and algorithmic decision-making.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluated both strategies against benchmark indices and each other.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Programming Languages**: R, Python and Excel
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: PerformanceAnalytics (R), pandas, numpy (Python)
- **Visualization Tools**: ggplot2 (R), matplotlib, seaborn (Python)
- **Financial APIs**: Yahoo Finance, Alpaca API
- **Machine Learning**: Sentiment analysis for news headlines
- **Statistical Measures**: Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Alpha, Beta, Drawdown analysis
- **Technical Indicators**: Simple Moving Average (SMA), MACD, Bollinger Bands

## Conclusion
While AI demonstrates significant potential in financial analytics, particularly in data processing and rapid execution, this study underscores the continued importance of human judgment in investment strategies. A hybrid approach that integrates AI algorithms with human oversight may offer the most robust solution for navigating complex financial markets, capitalizing on opportunities, and effectively mitigating risks.

## Future Directions
Further research could explore more sophisticated AI models, incorporate a wider range of market data, and investigate the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches in various market conditions.
