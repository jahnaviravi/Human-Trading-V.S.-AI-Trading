This project presents a comparative study exploring the efficacy of human-driven trading methodologies against AI-powered approaches in portfolio management within the stock market. Beginning with a meticulous selection process, we curate 4 diversified portfolios of 5 stocks each (one by human, one by GPT 3.5, one by GPT 4 and one by AI performance metric analysis) across key sectors, employing a range of financial metrics to identify optimal candidates. Subsequently, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both human and AI trading portfolios, leveraging analytical techniques including adjusted closing price trends, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA). Additionally, we delve into the development and performance analysis of AI-driven trading strategies, utilizing machine learning algorithms for autonomous decision-making. Through rigorous analysis and comparison against traditional benchmarks such as the SPY Index, we aim to elucidate the strengths and limitations of each approach. Employing a variety of programming languages and tools including R, Python, and Excel, our study provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of financial analytics, shedding light on the symbiotic relationship between human expertise and machine intelligence in navigating the complexities of the financial markets.
